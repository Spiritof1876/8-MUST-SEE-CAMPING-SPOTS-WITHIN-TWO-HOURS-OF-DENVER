                    <h2>Escape the city for the weekend and connect with nature at these eight amazing campsites</h2>
                    <p>Got all your gear and ready to hit the road? Looking for a weekend adventure but can’t go too far? Well load up your <a href="https://spiritof1876.com/teardrop-trailers"><u>teardrop trailer</u></a> or <a href="https://spiritof1876.com/shop/rooftop-tents"><u>rooftop tent</u></a> because we’ve got some sweet suggestions for you within a two hour drive from the Denver Metro area.</p>
                    <p>Check out these eight must-see camping spots perfect for a quick Colorado getaway:</p>
                    <h2>1. Asplenglen Campground - Estes Park, CO - 1.5 hours/68 miles from Denver</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/233187"><u>Aspenglen Campground</u></a> is located on the Fall River entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park. This campsite is just a short drive into the town of Estes Park and provides luscious craggy views, an abundance of Douglas firs, wildflowers in bloom, herds of mule deer and our famous Rocky Mountain elk. At Aspenglen, you’ll never run out of things to do, no matter your camping skill level. There are several hiking trailheads, fishing and kayaking areas, and scenic driving routes. The campground offers RV and camper sites, as well as walk-in campground spots. Every campsite is outfitted with a fire pit, tent pad, and picnic table—making it the perfect spot for your roof top tent or teardrop camper.</p>
                    <h2>2. Jones Pass Road - Empire, CO - 1 hour 15 mins/55 miles from Denver</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/arp/recarea/?recid=28436"><u>Jones Pass Road</u></a> is technically a dispersed campsite, but it’s easily accessible by car. To access the sites, exit I-70 and follow the signs down the road where you’ll begin to see campsites. The further out you go, the more dispersed the sites are. Jones Pass provides a ton of hiking trails for beginner to intermediate hikers, gorgeous Aspen trees, and some breathtaking mountain views of St. Mary’s Glacier. When camping here, you can get the full experience of being off the grid without actually being too far.</p>
                    <h2>3. Beartracks Lake - Evergreen, CO - 1.5 hours/60 miles from Denve</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/cs/recarea?ss=110308&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=FSE_003738&navid=110240000000000&pnavid=110000000000000&position=generalinfo&recid=28380&ttype=recarea&pname=Beartracks%20Lake%20Trail%20("><u>The Beartracks Lake Trail</u></a> is nestled up to the Mt. Evans State wildlife area. The trail travels the ridge between Truesdell Creek and Beartrack Creek up to Lower Beartrack Lake. During the summer months this is an increasingly popular hiking area, so make sure to get there and set up camp before it gets too crowded. This is another dispersed camp site, so all sites are off-road. These sites offer some of the best hiking near Denver, as well as gorgeous views of Mt. Evans, waterfront camping, and some great little fishing areas.</p>
                    <h2>4. Rainbow Lakes Campground - Nederland, CO - 1.5hours/55 miles from Denver</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/arp/recarea/?recid=28324"><u>Rainbow Lakes</u></a> is the perfect campsite if you want to get out there, but not too far. It’s one of the most undeveloped campsites in Boulder County, so it still feels like you’re really roughing it while being somewhat near civilization. The campsite has 18 spots, ranging from trailer and RV to walk-in tent sites (and is great for popping up your roof top tent!). Rainbow Lakes provides some of the best backcountry hiking near Denver, with trails that overlook a scenic view of the nine chain lakes surrounding the campsite.</p>
